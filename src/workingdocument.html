    What is your biggest strength?
  </section>

  <section class='situation-task'>
    My ability and desire to learn. I took a year-long class called CoderGirl
    where I started out not knowing how to code.
  </section>

  <section class='action'>
    I went to class every Wednesday and studied before work.
    I would get frustrated and want to give up at times. Instead I took short breaks.
    I woke up early before work to do class work.

  <section class='result'>
    Incorporating concepts I learned in CoderGirl, I went from knowing nothing
    about programming, to building a project using JavaScript with React as a
    framework integrating Node for a database and incorporating multiple APIs.
    I was able to create something that showcased the hard work and effort it took
    to learn a new skill.
